How jenkins is going to conusme your code and do a build process.  

 

To do the same we need to create Jobs in jenkins 

 

Discard old build : when you build an application a war or jar file creaed.  

Role strategy pluging.  

 

Build periodically : 15 min every 15 min if there Is change or no change it is going to build it  

Poll SCM- source code management- every 15 min it is going go to git check for any changes in your application .  

Using jenkins whenever you build an application- it is going to create a folder in your machine .  

 

Cd /var/lib/jenkins 

 

The difference beween a user and role is that user will have password based authentication 

Role can be assumed it is similar to user but can be assumed. If you donâ€™t create a role you cannot attach an user.
