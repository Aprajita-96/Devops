When we talk about configuration management.  

There are two type of system one is push based another is pull based system.  

 

Ansible Push Based System 
figurati 
How the authentication work in push 
based system. 
keypair based you generate a key in 
master save the private key in worker. 
Pull Based System

How to install ansible 

 131  yum install epel-release 

  132  yum install ansible 

  133  ssh-keygen -t rsa 

When you install ansible autmatically an configuration file and an inventory file is geeting stored in /etc/ansible 

 

This is called as static inventory.  

Dynamic Inventory : in cloud we will always have dynamic inventory.  

 

Ping is  a module develop in python. Which ansible already have it in the system when we install ansible.

Gather fact 

 

Ansible by default running the setup module to get your system information and update the patch according to it.  

Idopetence.  

So if your apache server is running on few of the some of the server it is down.  

It will skip the running server and start only the server where it is not running.  

 

Where did this fact module will not work.  

There are lot of networking and firewall system which do not use python. Or having there own operating system  

Junos or polo alto.  

Gather_fact = false 

 

 

The command which we have run till know it is also called as ansible ad hoc command 

Ansible hostgroup module argument  to the module 

Suppose I want to see the uptime of all the system 

 

131  ansible worker -m command -a uptime 

  132  ansible worker -m shell -a uptime 

  133  ansible worker -a uptime 

  134  ansible worker -a "free -m" 

  135  ansible worker -m file -a "path=/tmp/x state=directory mode=0755" 

  136  ansible worker -m group -a "name=weblogic state=present" 

  137  ansible worker -m user -a "name=weblogic group=weblogic createhome=yes" 

  138  ansible -m file -a "path=/tmp/x group=weblogic owner=weblogic" 

  139  ansible worker -m file -a "path=/tmp/x group=weblogic owner=weblogic" 

 

 

Ansible install a package 

133  ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=installed" 

  134  ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=install" 

  135  ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started enabled=yes" 

  136  ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=start enabled=yes" 

 

I want to install a apache packe 

Start and enable the httpd service.  

Install firewalld 

Start and enable firewalld service 

Permit http service at friewall 

We have a webpage need to install  

Give a name to the webserver 

Update some entry in /etc/hosts file 

 

To overcome this challenge where I want to run multiple task  

We can use a script.  

Ansible has something called as playbook where we can run our task.  

To do the same we need to write down a playbook. Using yaml 

 

 

--- 

 

 

# YAML documents begin with the document separator --- 

 

# The minus in YAML this indicates a list item. The playbook contains a list  

 

# of plays, with each play being a dictionary 

 

- 

 

# Target: where our play will run and options it will run with 

 

# Variable: variables that will apply to the play, on all target systems 

 

# Task: the list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section 

 

# can also be used for pre and post tasks 

 

# Handlers: handlers that are executed as a notify key from a task 

 

# Roles: list of roles to be imported into the play 

 

# Three dots indicate the end of a YAML document 

 

...

Handle will execute only if there is some changes.  

 

176  cd test/
