How to create our own custom images.  

Suppose you got an war or jar file how we going to convert the same into an container image.  

 

To convert the same into an container image 

We will a file called as docker file.  

Inisde that we will provide instruction.  

 

We create a Jar file which is an executable file in java. Now I want to convert the same in a container image.  

To do the same we create a file called as docker file and provide instruction.  

 

[root@control test]# cat dockerfile 

FROM java:8 #the from instruction will download the java 8 base image and spin a container for you 

WORKDIR / #inside the container I have create a folder using workdir.  

ADD src:/HelloWorld.jar dest inside containerHelloWorld.jar #this add instruction will Copy your HelloWorld.jar file inside the Workdir of the container 

EXPOSE 8080 #whenever we launch our container by default internally inside your docker machint it will run internally on port 8080 

CMD java -jar HelloWorld.jar #this instruction will run your jar file.  

 

[root@control test]# docker build -t myworld(name of the image created for your) . #docker build command will always look for a file dockerfile 

Sending build context to Docker daemon  111.6kB

Your application need to be ready 

Once your application Is ready create a docker file provide instruction to convert the application into an image  

Once you do the same using docker build command we will convert our application into an container image 

Then tag the image as per your docker hub crediantial 

Then do docker login in the machine 

And finally push the image to hub.docker.com 

 

We will frequently make changes in the application ? Then what we need to do.  

But we donâ€™t want what we want is if I make changes in my image autmatically a container image will be created
